Stress tests performed:
For the Sysdig Agent, stress testing was conducted by attempting to write approximately 1000 files to /tmp and /etc within a one-minute period, simulating system tampering activity. This generated elevated host-level telemetry including CPU usage, memory pressure, and increased process activity—all of which are captured and processed by the Sysdig Agent. These stress conditions validated the agent’s ability to monitor system behavior under load. Spikes in both CPU and memory usage were clearly visible in Grafana for the Sysdig Agent pod. It was also noted that CPU usage initially peaked around 500 millicores when the cluster was first created before stabilizing, which was factored in when determining the appropriate resource requests and limits.

For ClusterShield, the stress test involved simulating repeated outbound network connections using nc, along with attempts to write over 800 files to the /etc/ directory. These actions are designed to trigger ClusterShield’s runtime detection rules and generate sustained detection load, thereby driving CPU and memory utilization. However, across multiple test iterations, we observed minimal spikes in resource usage for ClusterShield. Based on these results, along with baseline resource consumption metrics, I’ve defined appropriate CPU and memory values to ensure stability without over-provisioning.
