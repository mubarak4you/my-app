Stress tests performed:For sysdig agent stress tests was performed by attempting to write about 1000 files to /tmp and /etc/ in the span of a minute which simulates tampering. This increases host level telemetry such as cpu memory and process activity whcih are captured and procced by the sysdig agent validating its monitoring under pressure. We can see spikes on the pod memory usage and pod cpu usage on grafana for the sysdig agent. Also observed that the CPU request for when the cluster is intially created is about 500 mcores before leveling out so accounting for this when setting the Request and limits. For clustershield, stress tests was performed by simulating various outbound connections with nc and also attemptying to write over 800 files to /etc/  which triggers clustershields runtime security rules while generating detection load and pushing cpu and memory usgage clustershield stress test did not see much spikes from various tests performed, I have set the recommened cpu and mem values based on the result and baseline values.
