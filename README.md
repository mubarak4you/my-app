Based on the results from the graph analysis:

    The maximum peak bandwidth observed was 3.122 Mb/s (approximately 25 Mbps).
    The minimum peak bandwidth observed was 0.022 Mb/s (approximately 0.176 Mbps).
    The mean peak bandwidth was calculated as 0.217 Mb/s (approximately 1.736 Mbps).

Considering these results, along with observations from this cluster and other clusters tested, the bandwidth configuration has been set with an added buffer for maximum and minimum bandwidth:

maxBandwidthMbps: 40
minBandwidthMbps: 10
